## Beautiful React component library.

A library of UI components used across Lundegaard's @fast-ai projects. Goal of this library is to provide one base from which components could be shared and reused, thus offering one central point for further development and improvements.

# Getting started
Setup your own project and add @fast-ai/ui-components as your dependency

```
yarn add @fast-ai/ui-components
```

or

```
npm install @fast-ai/ui-components
```
